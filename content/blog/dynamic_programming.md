## Introduction to Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It's particularly useful when the problem has overlapping subproblems and an optimal substructure.

## Key Principles

1. **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to a problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: The same subproblems are solved multiple times when finding the solution.


## Implementation Example: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of a problem that can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming:

```cpp
int fibonacci(int n) {
    // Base cases
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    
    // Memo Table
    int dp[n+1];
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;
    
    // Fill up the dp array
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}
```

This solution has O(n) time complexity, which is much better than the exponential time complexity of a naÃ¯ve recursive approach.  

## When to Use Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is useful for optimization problems where:  
* The problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems
* There is an optimal substructure
* You need to find the optimal value (maximum or minimum)

Common examples include:  
* Shortest path problems
* Knapsack problems
* Sequence alignment
* Matrix chain multiplication

## Conclusion
Dynamic programming can be challenging to master, but once you understand its principles, it becomes a powerful tool in your algorithm toolkit. Practice with simple problems first before tackling more complex ones.  Stay tuned for more advanced dynamic programming techniques in my next blog post!
