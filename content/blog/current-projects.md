### Projects List (Completed / Onhold for Ideas / Improvements)
1. **Artificial Intelligence with Reprompting and Code Execution for Problem Solving**

**Description**:

The project takes in a problem statement, generates code to solve the problem, and then evaluates the code to determine if it meets the requirements. If the code does not meet the requirements, it generates a new prompt to improve the code. This process continues until the code meets the requirements or a maximum number of iterations is reached. This is an extremely simplified version of Google's Alpha Evolve, which includes a component to improve the prompt based on the evaluation of the code. 

**Further Improvements**
1. Add more sophisticated evaluation metrics to determine if the code meets the requirements.
2. Implement a more advanced prompt improvement strategy based on the evaluation results.
