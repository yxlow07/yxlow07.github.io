## Introduction
As more and more people are using the Internet, a new trend emerged: doom scrolling. This often happens because of short attention spans and need for constant stimulation. I've experienced this myself, and I thought, wouldn't it be perfect to have a doom scroller, but for A Level Students?

## The Must-Have Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in to the app with their profiles
- **Doom Scrolling**: The main part of the app, where instead of videos, you scroll through A Level questions
- **Feed Customization**: Users can choose their subjects, topics and papers -> e.g. "Chemistry, Equilibrium, Paper 1"
- **AI Question Marker**: An AI that marks questions involving more complex answers, such as structure questions, etc.
- **Reward System**: Earn points for questions answered
- **Questions Saver**: Save questions to a list for later
- **AI Algorithm**: An algorithm that gets your weakest topics and put them in your feed
- **Leaderboard**: A leaderboard that shows the top scorers of the app
- **AI Study Techniques Integration**: Applies spaced repetition and other techniques to the questions in the feed
- **Intuitive UI**: Similar to apps in the market, users know how to use it immediately

## Not Important, But Future Features
- Support for other exam boards, such as Edexcel...

## Current Challenges
- **AI Algorithms**: Creating an AI that perform the aforementioned tasks is complex.
- **Cost**: The cost of running AIs might skyrocket.
- **Question Bank**: Creating a question bank by extracting from past papers is tedious but hard to automate.
